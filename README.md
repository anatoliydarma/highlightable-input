The project involves creating a Laravel Livewire component that functions as a textarea, where variables are highlighted in the text for example like in the screenshot. A variable is defined as a string that begins with "{{" and ends with "}}", with only lowercase letters a-z and \_ allowed between the brackets.

In addition to the highlighting functionality, I also need a function or variable that returns all valid variables found within the text. Add a function that returns a boolean to validate if the text in the textarea is valid - with a non valid varialbe this function should return false. The entire component should be rendered in real-time.

Please style everything with Tailwind and this component should look good in a new Laravel Jetstream project.
